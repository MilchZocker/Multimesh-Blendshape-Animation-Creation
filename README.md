# Multimesh-Blendshape-Animation-Creation
The Blendshape Animation Creator is a Unity Editor tool that simplifies the process of creating animation clips for blendshapes in 3D models. It generates two clips for specified blendshapes, allowing for variations in naming conventions, and ensures compatibility with Unity's Animator and Blend Trees.
